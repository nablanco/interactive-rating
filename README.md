## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating
- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was my second project using React and my first using hooks (useState) and Styled Components. The project allowed me to practice the React basics I had learned in my previous project, while adding new complications around state management and a new styling approach. I view this project as more of a 'tune-up' before the next project I intended to work on, a space travel website, which would put everything I had learned so far to the test.
